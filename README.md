# aleiphoenix's config files
this repo is just some dirty config files of mine... you can find some sort of them, including...

+ bashrc
+ vim configuration
+ ssh_config and sshd_config
+ fontconfig for X11
+ xfce desktop
+ and everythings I'm currently using or used

I try to comment on them. So if you find them helpful, I'm really happy.
If you've got something more awesome or have some to say, just drop a comment ;)
